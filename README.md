This python script to solve Wordle 99% of the time within 6 attempts.

You can go ahead and run main.py to run it for all 2315 Wordle words and it solves 99% of them correctly within 6 attempts. 

# Instructions 
- Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/Mo-Shakib/Wordle-Solver```
- Run: ```main.py```
## If you get any green block, you must maintain the position
For example:
if you get something  like this ⬜️🟩️⬜️⬜️🟩️, then you need to enter ```_``` for white blocks and the letter in position -> ```_ b _ _ d```
For yellow blocks, you just need to enter the letters, separated by space.

Disclaimer: There are lots of scope to optimize the solving part and minimize redundant calculations. Any contribution is welcome.
